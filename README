I worked on this project when I took the course of Object Oriented Programming in Java offered by UC San Diego. UC San Diego Intermediate Software Development MOOC team provided a skeleton to use Unfolding library API. 

How to run:
1. Run EarthquakeCityMap.java to visualize earthquakes on Google Map.
2. Run AirportMarker.java to visualize airlines on Google Map.

Troubleshooting:
1. Switch Java Compiler to 1.6 if you get VM problems. (Processing should work with Java 1.6, and 1.7).
2. If you run EarthquakeCityMap.java and get error: 
  403 for URL: http://mt1.google.com/vt/lyrs=m@116&hl=de&x=1&y=2&z=2&s=Galileo 
please change code to switch to offline mode. It seems like the map server from Google (mt1.google.com) isn't available sometime.
3. For user using computer with swithable graphics, you may encounter LoadLibrary failed with error 1114. To solve the issue, switch graphics global setting to "Maximize performance".
