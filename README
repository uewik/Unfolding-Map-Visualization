I did this project when I took the course of Object Oriented Programming in Java offered by UC San Diego through Coursera. UC San Diego Intermediate Software Development MOOC team provided a skeleton to use Unfolding library API and some starter code. 

Description:

Earthquake visualization:
- Used Processing API to implement GUI design
- Used Unfolding library API to visualize earthquakes and cities on Google Map
- Program gets worldwide earthquake data by parsing XML file of USGS Feed
- Information will be displayed when a user hovers over any marker on the map
- When a user clicks an earthquake mark on the map, affected cities will be shown on the map
- When a user clicks a city mark on the map, earthquakes that could affects this city will be shown on the map

Airline routes visualization:
- Used Processing API to implement GUI design
- Used Unfolding library API to visualize airports on the map
- Airport information will be displayed when a user hovers over any marker on the map
- When a user clicks an airport mark on the map, destination airports and airline routes will be shown on the map

How to run:
1. Run EarthquakeCityMap.java to visualize earthquakes on Google Map.
2. Run AirportMap.java to visualize airlines on Google Map.

Troubleshooting:
1. Switch Java Compiler to 1.6 if you get VM problems. (Processing should work with Java 1.6, and 1.7).
2. If you run EarthquakeCityMap.java and get error: 
  403 for URL: http://mt1.google.com/vt/lyrs=m@116&hl=de&x=1&y=2&z=2&s=Galileo 
please change code to switch to offline mode. It seems like the map server from Google (mt1.google.com) isn't available sometime.
3. For user using computer with swithable graphics, you may encounter LoadLibrary failed with error 1114. To solve the issue, switch graphics global setting to "Maximize performance".
